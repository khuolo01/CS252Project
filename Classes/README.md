At first, user will input username and password to access to manager functions. For new user, some accounts can be found in the file ManagerAccountList.txt. Username and password is separated by the symbol "|", and each line contains different account.

Inside the manager function, there are 5 usable funtions: Add New Worker, Create New Manager, Check Worker Information, Send Warning, and Item Manipulation.

In order to run the Send Warning, you may have to add the file "javax.mail.jar" to the Class Path.
